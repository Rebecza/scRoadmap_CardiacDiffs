Analysis performed on the RNA-seq data obtained day 14 embryoid body cultures, produced with ZNF711-KO, LHX2-KO and ZNF503-KO and treated either with or without retinoic acid at day 4.

Contains steps of performing the PCA and differential gene testing, visualizing marker genes obtained from the day 14 cell types of the scRoadmap presented in Figure 1 and testing the overlap between KO-target genes and the predicted scANANSE targets of ZNF711 and LHX2.

As presented in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures S11.
