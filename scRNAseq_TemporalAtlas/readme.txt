Analysis performed on the single-cell RNA-seq data obtained from different culture methods (Monolayer, Embryoid Body and Engineered Heart Tissues), either treated with Retinoic Acid (Atrial protocol) or not. 

Contains steps of preprocessing the spliced and unspliced counts obtained from mapping with Kallisto | Bustools (and the protocol of CEL-Seq2 was used for the scRNA-seq), integration of different experiments performed, validation of the Seurat integration, the dimensionality reduction and clustering that was performed, and the comparison with in vivo data. 

As presented in Figure 1, Supplementary Figures S2, S4, S5, S7.
